description: When it comes to connecting devices or applications on the Internet APIs
  is the way. With the explosive invasion of new technologies (mobile devices, Internet
  of Things, M2M) even individual developers working on small applications need to
  resolve to APIs, resulting in the creation of a vast &amp; new market. As an increasing
  amount of APIs will be embedded in applications, the need to be in tune with the
  inner workings of an API will equally increase. We dont just need access to the
  results of an API anymore, we need to understand the composition of the APIs we
  depend on and modify them based on the context of our application. Apirise provides
  an environment that significantly minimizes the time and effort required to integrate
  APIs by making possible to modify all necessary data and services so that they can
  automatically be obtained as needed by the context of your application.
